            <h2>About us</h2>
            <p>Have you decided to get a puppy? Congratulations - your life has just become fluffier, louder, and a hundred times more fun!</p>
            <p>DogStarter was created so that the first days with a puppy don‚Äôt look like chaos. We help you figure out what you need to prepare before the puppy arrives...</p>
            <ul>
                <li>What you need to buy before you bring your puppy home</li>
                <li>How to prepare a safe space</li>
                <li>The first days with your puppy</li>
                <li>The basics of first feeding, hygiene, and play</li>
                <li>Tips for toilet training and routines</li>
                <li>First steps to obedience: introduction to commands, collar, and leash</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We were once in your shoes - with confused eyes and a lot of questions. That‚Äôs why we decided to create DogStarter - to make the beginning of the story of ‚Äúme and my dog‚Äù not stressful, but a pleasant adventure üíï</p>
